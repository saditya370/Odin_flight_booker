# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
  require "faker"
  

# 10.times do 

#     Airport.create(airport_name: Faker::Nation.unique.capital_city)
# end

# Flight.create(departure_airport_id: 42 ,arrival_airport_id: 46,flight_duration: 6,flight_date_time: DateTime.now)


# air = Airport.ids
# b = 0
# c = air.length

# while b<air.length
#     i =0
#  while i<c-1
#     Flight.create(departure_airport_id: air[i] ,arrival_airport_id: air[i+1],flight_duration: 5,flight_date: "25-02-2023",)
#     i -= 1
#  end
  
#     b = b + 1
